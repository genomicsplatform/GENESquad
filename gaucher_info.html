					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
					Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by the mutation of a gene that is responsible 
					for an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase which the body needs to break down 
					glucocerebroside, a kind of fat. In GD, the body is not able to produce sufficient 
					amounts of this enzyme and thus the fat is not broken down. It accumulates mostly 
					in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. GD is a genetic disorder prevalent among the 
					Ashkenazi Jewish population. It affects them more when compared to the general 
					European population. To diagnose GD, it is important to know the clinical history, 
					conduct a physical examination, laboratory tests confirmed by a blood test showing 
					deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme and genetic analysis for the causal gene mutations 
					in the GBA gene. GD can result in pain, fatigue, jaundice, bone damage, anemia, and even 
					death. The most common form of treatment for GD is enzyme replacement which is available 
					for most people. Such treatment helps decrease liver and spleen size, reduce skeletal 
					abnormalities, and reverse other symptoms. On rare occasions, surgical removal of the 
					whole or part of the spleen may be necessary. While blood transfusions are also known 
					to benefit some anemic patients, to improve quality of life and mobility some patients 
					may also require joint replacement surgery. There is no effective treatment for severe 
					brain damage that may occur in certain patients with GD.
