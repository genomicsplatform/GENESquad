					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
					In 1972, Japanese Pathologists Kikuchi and Fujimoto first discovered the 
					Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. 
					While the exact cause of this rare, benign, and self-limiting disease is unknown, 
					it was initially thought to mainly affect young women of Asian origin. Many researchers 
					suspect that a virus triggers this disorder. Others, however, believe that the disorder 
					is a self-limited autoimmune condition. The disease has since been reported worldwide, 
					especially in Japan, Europe as well as the U.S. The disease is known to affect people of 
					varying ages, however, younger adults (less than 40 years) are more prone to it. Most 
					reports show female predominance; however, some studies from Asian countries suggest 
					that the male to female ratio is closer to 1:1 and not 4:1 as previously thought. 
					Swelling of glands is a common occurrence in this disease and the gold standard diagnostic 
					test for this disease is the histopathological analysis of excised lymph node biopsy 
					specimen, however, immunohistochemical stains can be helpful in cases with limited material. 
					Pathologists should be familiar with this entity to avoid a misdiagnosis of lymphoma, which 
					could lead to unnecessary and aggressive therapy. KFD usually resolves itself within a few 
					weeks or months, however, Analgesics-antipyretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) 
					may be used to treat pain, tenderness, and fever associated with lymphadenopathy. In extremely 
					rare cases, Kikuchi's disease may recur.
