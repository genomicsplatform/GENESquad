					<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
					</br>
					<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
					<p>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
						GENESquad was formed by Amanda Z., Rachel H., Johan J., Saloni S., and Celestina L. 
						with the help from our mentor Mrs. Lia Kwee Isaac with the intent of extending science 
						as a service to those who need it most. As such, we aim to pursue an approach that is based 
						on equity and equality, with an emphasis on the former. Our team does this by placing the problems 
						faced by underserved communities at the forefront of our project. Though any advancement of knowledge 
						in the area of rare diseases is essential, we believe in first maximizing that which already exists. 
						Currently, we are developing a free, open-source platform which pools data on Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease 
						and Gaucher disease—two huge healthcare concerns on which public awareness is highly limited. 
						</br>
						</br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
						Creating this platform also entails the ensured delivery of its services to the target communities. 
						We believe it is also our responsibility to connect with our friends and partners all over the world, 
						the way this project has brought our team members together. And just like with every initiative founded 
						on technology, we want our platform to become a catalyst for concrete action and social change. Online 
						public information is just the beginning, and with the endless potential posed by this platform, humanity’s 
						battle against rare diseases will resume—this time with a bigger, stronger army. 
					</p>
					</br>
					<h4>Public Access of Data</h4>
					<p>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
						For GENESquad’s project, we may use the CC0 license. According to the Creative Commons website, 
						“in no way are the patent or trademark rights of any person affected by CC0, nor are the rights that other 
						persons may have in the work or in how the work is used, such as publicity or privacy rights” (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a>). 
						This allows the use of the featured data sets, which are all publicly available in the first place, by any 
						interested parties without compromising the individual rights of those involved (e.g. patients of the diseases).
						</br>
						</br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
						In line with our goal of universal accessibility, the CC BY (Attribution) and CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike) 
						licenses will also be used (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a>, <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/core-data-resources" target="_blank">ELIXIR</a>). 
						These licenses allow for free reproduction, distribution, 
						and adaptation of our content, whether commercial or not, provided that any derivatives must be credited to the 
						original owners and distributed under the same licenses. This explains the need for us to feature only those data 
						sets which follow the same terms of use as described above. 
						</br>
						</br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
						Like the data set we found for Gaucher’s disease, other biological data to be featured on our site will come from 
						other Open Access sources such as BioGPS, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ELIXIR Core Data Resources, among others. 
						BioGPS and GEO both rely on community intelligence, or the “idea that a large community of users can collectively and 
						collaboratively synthesize knowledge” (<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2009-10-11-r130#Sec5" target="_blank">Genome Biology</a>). As such, our platform shall follow the same general principle by pooling 
						pieces of information in one site. The main difference, however, is that all content will be moderated by us, the administrators, 
						with the help of our mentors and other experts in the field of rare diseases. Not only does this maintain security of the data, 
						but this is also the default situation as there is not a large enough “community” of contributors to begin with.
					</p>
					</br>
					<h4>Data Privacy</h4>
					<p>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
						Aside from the use of publicly available information, our platform shall also include baseline data about rare diseases 
						from far-flung communities. As such, the research projects that will produce these data shall be subject to the appropriate 
						ethics review and informed consent procedures, among others. Due to the delicate nature of both rare disease diagnostics 
						and research ethics, only the work of trusted, credible scientists from established institutions shall be reviewed for 
						possible inclusion on our platform. The data privacy intricacies of each study shall be the responsibility of their 
						respective authors. As much as possible, any featured studies, especially baseline researches, must be peer-reviewed 
						and/or published on an open access platform.
